    "component": "/pallets/moonbeam-foreign-assets/src/lib.rs",
    "description": "The function to create a new foreign asset ensures its XCM location does not already exist. However, a separate governance function to change an asset's XCM location ('change_xcm_location') fails to perform the same check, making it possible to assign a location that is already in use.",
    "impact": "A malicious or accidental governance action could configure multiple foreign assets to use the same XCM location. This would cause collisions in asset resolution, leading to confusion and undefined behavior.",
    "kind": "Implementation"
